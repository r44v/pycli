⚠️ this project is made for my personal use and might change completly based on my mood.

## Installation

from the project root install it like this:

```
pip install --user -e .
```

this allows you to change to code in the repository and it will directly reflect in the tool.

## Dependencies

I started the idea with using as much pure python as possible but later started using it to make quick helpers for day to day tasks so now some functions have the following dependencies, only for their respective functions.

The tool is mainly used with windows, so some features may break on another OS.
